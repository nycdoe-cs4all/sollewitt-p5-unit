# 7: Discussion: Sol le Witt, Mediums, Concept

### Teacher Notes and Overview

This lesson provides space for students to process their thoughts around art and what they have learned in this unit prior to reaching the final project via a discussion protocol. While the lesson is planned for a single day, if you have a group of students that are especially into discussion, you can absolutely draw this lesson out for multiple periods.\
\
Please note that for this to be successful, there is some advanced prep in the form of creating chart paper posters that must be done - make sure to budget your time accordingly!

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Analyze and discuss the role of instructions, algorithms, and medium in Sol LeWitt's art and art generally, demonstrating an understanding of how these elements shape the conceptual and visual aspects of art
* Evaluate the impact of medium choice on the interpretation and appreciation of art, both in Sol LeWitt's works and in contemporary art
* Engage in a thoughtful, well-structured group discussion using the provided discussion questions and their own viewpoints

### Suggested Duration

1 Day

### NYS Standards

1. **Standard 1: Creating, Performing, and Participating in the Arts**:
2. **Standard 2: Knowing and Using Arts Materials and Resources**:
3. **Standard 3: Responding to and Analyzing Works of Art**:
4. **Standard 4: Understanding the Cultural Dimensions and Contributions of the Arts**:

### Vocabulary

* **medium**
* **concept**
* **intention**

### Planning Notes and Materials

_The chalk talk will require chart paper with questions pre-written, and either markers or post-its for students to share their thoughts. Be sure both are ready and spread throughout the class space!_

### Resources

* [Chalk Talk Protocol](https://www.nsrfharmony.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/chalk\_talk\_0.pdf)

### Assessments

**Formative:**

Chalk Talk Activity

**Summative:**

Final Project, Pt 1 and 2

Final Unit Reflection

### Do Now/Warm Up (\~2 min - 3 min)

**EITHER:**

Ask students to draw a simple, abstract design on the page. They will then swap with a neighbor who will try to explain the algorithm for the drawing in one sentence.

**OR:**

Display a simple, abstract design on the board. Ask students to explaint he algorithm for the drawing in 1-2 sentences. (_We recommend using the Prince symbol for a nice throwback!_)

### Framing the Discussion (\~2 - 5 minutes)

Explain to students that you have now had time in the lesson to discuss Sol LeWitt and Algorithms and to get a solid understanding of code. Originally, Sol would have never imagined that his art would be recreated in code.\
\
Today is going to give everyone a chance to discuss if creating art in code vs virtually changes the meaning or impact of the art, among other relevant topics. We will be doing this as a chalk talk protocol.\
\
Around the room, have chart paper posted with the following questions - **try to choose at least 5-6 to focus on**:

_**NB**: Students need space to leave thoughts on the chart paper - so if the questions threaten to take up too much space writing them on, consider printing and pasting._

1. How would you describe Sol LeWitt's art?&#x20;
2. Do you see Sol LeWitt's art as the set of instructions (algorithm) or the final output on the wall?
3. Some critics argue that Sol LeWitt's art reduces the role of the artist to that of a concept generator. Do you agree with this perspective? (Explain!)
4. How does the concept of conceptual art challenge traditional notions of artistic creativity and authorship?
5. Sol LeWitt's art often involved various mediums. How does the choice of medium influence the perception and interpretation of art, generally?
6. In algorithmic art, instructions play a crucial role. How much freedom should an artist allow for interpretation when providing instructions for their artwork?
7. Do you think providing explicit instructions in art enhances or restricts the viewer's engagement and understanding?
8. How has the advent of digital technologies and algorithms expanded the concept of art in the 21st century? What are the new possibilities and challenges?
9. In a world where art can be created through algorithms, what defines the boundaries of art and creativity?
10. In the digital age, we have seen an increasing integration of technology and algorithms in art. How has this transformation affected the way we perceive and create art?

### Chalk Talk (\~15 minutes)

Ensure all students have a marker and/or pen/post-its so they can add their thoughts to the questions posted around the room. Explain that the chalktalk is a silent activity that will take place for _at least_ 15 minutes.

Students will circulate and add their thoughts to each question. If they see a thought they agree with, they can put a check or plus next to it in addition to adding their own thoughts on as well. Because of this, students should review questions they've already visited to see what notes have been added. There may be moments where it seems like students are done before the time is up; this is okay! Let them keep circulating for the full time, and extend time as needed if they feel engaged.

**NB**: _To make your life easier, you may want to initially have student groups start at different chart papers - make sure they understand they can move when they are ready, you will not be announcing, but this is to ensure there is no initial crowd of people._

Once the Chalk Talk is completed, ask students to return to their seats.

### Discussion (\~15 - 20 minutes)

Once students return to their seats, begin discussing the results of the chalk talk. For each of the 5-6 questions you selected, allow students to share their thoughts aloud with the group.\
\
You may want to ask prompting questions, such as:

1. What trends did we see emerge in the answers for x question?
2. Do we agree or disagree with what we saw people saying?
3. How do we think the general feelings will effect art we create?
4. What are next steps we should be taking, or things we should be thinking about, after these conclusions?

### Wrap-Up (\~3 - 5 minutes)

End the session by thanking students for their time and deep thoughts - explain that we are at the end of the unit and have one final project that will involve them making Sol LeWitt-esque art, both digitally and with traditional media. They will learn more in the next class!
