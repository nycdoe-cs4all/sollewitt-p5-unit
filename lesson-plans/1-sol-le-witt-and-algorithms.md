# 1: Sol Le Witt and Algorithms

### Teacher Notes and Overview

This lesson kicks off the unit by introducing students to a brief history of Sol LeWitt and the concept of algorithms. Students will discuss what 'art' is in instructional art - the instructions or the output - and will begin practicing what it takes to create 'good' algorithms.&#x20;

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Identify key aspects of Sol LeWitt's artistic style and conceptual approach.
* Differentiate between Sol LeWitt's instructions/algorithms and the visual output displayed in museums and galleries.
* Define the concept of algorithms and recognize their connection to both the work of Sol LeWitt and computing/coding.

### Suggested Duration

1 - 2 Days - this should only take 2 days if you choose to complete the optional extension activity, or if you decide to give significantly more time to the discussion portion.

### NYS Standards

\[NEED FOR ART AND CS]

### Vocabulary

* **Algorithm**: A set of step-by-step instructions or rules to be followed in problem-solving or completing a task.&#x20;
* **Conceptual Art:** Art in which the concept or idea behind the work is more important than the traditional aesthetic and material concerns.&#x20;
* **Instruction Art:** Art that is created by following a set of predefined instructions or algorithms.&#x20;
* **Visual Output:** The tangible or visible result of an artistic process or set of instructions.

### Planning Notes and Materials

Students will need a small piece of paper, such as a post-it note or notecard, to begin class. If you choose to do the second day extension, you will need materials to make PB\&J sandwiches and gloves.

### Do Now/Warm Up (\~3 min)

Provide each student with a small piece of paper and ask them to quickly sketch a simple shape or pattern. This pattern/design is a _secret_ - they should not show it to anyone. When they are done, ask them to put it aside for later in the lesson, and remind them once more to keep it hidden and secret.

### Introducing: Sol LeWitt (\~5 minutes)

Explain to students that the class is beginning a new unit that will focus on Sol LeWitt. Solomon "Sol" LeWitt (1928â€“2007) was an American artist best known for his pioneering contributions to conceptual and instruction-based art. Born in Hartford, Connecticut, LeWitt emerged as a prominent figure in the art world during the 1960s and 1970s, challenging traditional notions of art creation and authorship.\
\
LeWitt's artistic philosophy was deeply rooted in the rejection of the emotional, expressive aspects of traditional art. He sought to explore ideas and concepts as the primary focus of his work, shifting the emphasis from the artist's hand to the intellectual process behind the creation.

If you went to a museum to see a Sol LeWitt piece, you would see something like this - likely taking up a massive wall or walls:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Sol LeWitt Wall Drawing #337</p></figcaption></figure>

However, the drawing on this wall was not actually drawn by the hand of Sol LeWitt. Rather, the Sol LeWitt piece that the museum owns/has in its collection looks like this:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Certified Sol LeWitt instructions for Wall Drawing #337</p></figcaption></figure>

LeWitt's groundbreaking contribution was the development of instruction-based art. He conceived a system where the artist provides a set of instructions or rules for the creation of an artwork, and the execution can be carried out by the artist or others. The final visual outcome became a product of the chosen algorithm rather than personal expression. This was showcased in his series of "Wall Drawings." These large-scale installations consist of intricate geometric patterns and shapes drawn directly onto walls. The execution of the drawings is often carried out by teams of assistants following LeWitt's detailed instructions.

### Group Discussion: Where is the Art? (\~10 minutes)

Ask students to begin by quietly responding to the following questions in their notebook or sketchbook:

* What distinguishes Sol LeWitt's art from traditional art forms?&#x20;
* How does Sol LeWitt's approach challenge the role of the artist?
* What do you view as the 'art' here - the instructions, or the output?

Once students have had a chance to gather their thoughts, ask them to discuss in small groups. You can use a round-robin protocol where each students shares for about 45 seconds - 1 minutes before rotating to the next, or allow open discussion depending on the needs of your class.

When students have shared in small groups, open it up to the class as a whole.

### Introducing: Algorithms (\~3-5 minutes)

After the discussion, explain to students that LeWitt's instructions could be viewed as an _algorithm._ An algorithm is essentially a set of instructions to do or complete something; they may have algorithms to solve certain problems in math class, for example.

Algorithms are also a key part of computer science, as coding is really just setting instructions for the computer to do something. Algorithms are so valuable in computer science that companies will pay to buy algorithms that allow certain processes to happen; there is currently a lot of legal debate as people figure out what it means to create or own a set of instructions. _(This is a conversational rabbit hole you are welcome to pursue - with a little extra research - or skip at your discretion!)_

In this unit, we will be thinking _algorithmically_ - using instructions - and will be making algorithmic/instruction-based art using the work and concepts of Sol LeWitt.

To practice this, we are going to begin testing what makes a good algorithm.

### Verbal Algorithm Challenge (\~10 minutes)

Put students in groups of 3-4. One at a time, students will take their drawn pattern from the Do Now and, without showing it to the group, try to describe how to recreate it. (Ex: _'Begin by drawing a small square in the top left corner...'_) Group members will try to follow these directions to recreate the drawings and get as close as possible to the original. Allow each group member about 1-2 minutes to try to describe while the group draws; give them a second to compare drawings, then switch to the next person.

### Wrap Up (\~3-5 Minutes)

Bring students back together. Students will spend some time reflecting on this activity, either as a group, or as part of an exit slip. Consider asking the following questions:

1. What was difficult about creating your verbal algorithm?
2. What did you learn from this activity?
3. How would this activity change if you were behind a curtain, or could not use your hands while explaining?

Let students know that tomorrow they will begin working with code. They will get a crash course into code basics as we move through the unit, and will then have choices in the final projects around using code vs. traditional media.

### Optional Extension

If you would like to spend more time on algorithms, consider asking students to write an algorithm to make a PB\&J sandwich as part of their homework, or as a brain starter for the next class.

Bring in PB\&J ingredients (sunflower seed butter is a good PB substitute for allergies, and is relatively inexpensive at Trader Joes) and gloves, paper plates, etc.&#x20;

Allow students to refine their algorithms in groups, and then each group will read their algorithm while you, the teacher, reenact in real-time. The most important part is that you are _as literal as possible_. If they say 'take some peanut butter' without telling you to pick up a knife, put your hand in the peanut butter jar. If they say 'put the knife in the jar' try to put the knife in the side of the jar instead of through the top, etc.\
\
Use this to build on the discussion of the importance of precise language from the first day lesson.
