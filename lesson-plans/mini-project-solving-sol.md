# ðŸ—ƒ Mini Project: Solving Sol

### Teacher Notes and Overview

This project is the students' first chance to put everything they have learned about code so far together to try to replicate Sol LeWitt's algorithmic instructions. A massive selection of these instructions has been compiled for use in the project; you may want to parse it down or otherwise place limits so as not to overwhelm students. You may also want to preview the prompts, as some are more difficult to do in a coded environment than others. While they do not need to be excluded, students may need to think outside the box and may need prompting on how to follow instructions while not being stuck on taking things too literally.

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Recreate Sol LeWitt instructions through a coded program
* Added interactivity or reactivity to a Sol LeWitt piece using code

### Suggested Duration

\~3 Days (_Time depending on speed of student work!_)

### NYS Standards

**9-12.CT.4** Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

**9-12.CT.8** Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

**9-12.DL.1** Type proficiently on a keyboard.

### Planning Notes and Materials

While students will be working digitally to code their final pieces, it is strongly encouraged that they do some sort of paper planning before they begin. You may want to brainstorm the best way to do this based on protocols already present in your classroom.

### Project Launch and Prompt

Putting together what they have learned, students will be asked to recreate **three** different Sol LeWitt pieces through coded programs. Prior to beginning, students should take time to plan their projects on paper, making notes of what they may need to do in their code along the way.

**Project Requirements:**

1. Select **three Sol LeWitt instructions - they must each be from a different year.**
2. Create a plan on paper for the execution of each sketch - this needs to be okay'd before you begin programming!
3. For each project, create a new p5 sketch where you will execute the directions through code.
   1. You may need to get creative in your interpretation, and that's okay!
4. In _at least_ one project, create an element or elements that will vary randomly so a new design is generated each time the program is run.
5. In _at least_ one project, create an element or elements that are responsive or interactive based on things the user does.

When students submit their work, consider asking them to respond to one or more of the following prompts:

1. What are you most proud of in this project? Why?
2. What did you struggle with in this project?
3. Explain your decision of what you made random. How does this fit with the instructions you were given?
4. Explain your decision of what you made responsive/interactive. How does this fit with the instructions you were given?
5. What would you do if you had more time and/or resources?

Before students finish the project, a gallery walk - either physically, or through links posted on an LMS like Google Classroom - can be a great way to get them inspired prior to the final project of the unit.
