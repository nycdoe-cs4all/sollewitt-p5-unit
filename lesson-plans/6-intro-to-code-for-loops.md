Feel free to reference [this Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/oqJTPyS2rUg) to get started on modulos. Another good introduction is to explain the modulo to students: it looks like a %, is sometimes written as MOD in code, and it does a _very specific thing._ Write a few examples on the board and ask students if they can figure out what's happening. Some examples might look like:

* 4 % 2 = 0
* 5 % 2 = 1
* 10 % 2 = 0
* 13 % 2 = 1

Or:

* 16 % 4 = 0
* 12 % 4 = 0
* 22 % 4 = 2
* 23 % 2 = 1

Try to give them examples where you are modding by several different numbers to avoid students generalizing incorrectly (like saying 'it gives 0 for even numbers and 1 for odd numbers'). The conclusion that students should come to, and the definition you should review together, is a modulo returns the REMAINDER of a division problem. 25 / 5 has no remainder, so 25 % 5 would equal 0. However, 27 / 5 would have a remainder of 2, so 27 % 5 equals 2.

This is a simple overview and mods are a very powerful tool in programming and encryption. A simple way for students to use them is to make things change based on if they are even or odd.
