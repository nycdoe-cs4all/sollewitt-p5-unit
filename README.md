# ðŸ”® Unit Overview

### ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION - BEING BUILT ðŸš§

This unit is intended to be integrated into high school visual arts classrooms. Because it is an integrated unit, the emphasis is on usable programming skills vs a deep dive into programming concepts, as may be the case in a computer science or programming course.&#x20;

Sol Le Witt: Code and Concept focuses on students learning to write code that produces visual, web-based designs and applications, and then moves into the discussion and importance of algorithms in programming. Specifically, it explores algorithms in computing and in relation to the work of Sol LeWitt, and would also include discussions around what can be considered art and how choice in media changes the output/concept of the work created. An emphasis is put on student creation of algorithms and visual work from algorithms on a computer and in non-digital media.

### Suggested Duration



### Pre-Requisites

While there are no specific pre-requisite requirements for this unit, it is recommended that students have an understanding of foundational art concepts. This unit works best in an established art class.

### Assessment

**Final Project:** Students will write Sol LeWitt style algorithms and will then create work in digital and traditional mediums using instructions written by their peers.
