# ðŸ”® Unit Overview

This unit is intended to be integrated into high school visual arts classrooms.&#x20;

It focuses on students learning to write code that produces visual, web-based designs and applications, and then moves into the discussion and importance of algorithms in programming. Specifically, it explores algorithms in computing and in relation to the work of Sol LeWitt, and would also include discussions around what can be considered art and how choice in media changes the output/concept of the work created. An emphasis is put on student creation of algorithms and visual work from algorithms on a computer and in non-digital media.
