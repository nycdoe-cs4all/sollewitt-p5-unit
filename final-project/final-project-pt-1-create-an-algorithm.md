# ðŸŽ¨ Final Project Pt 1: Create an Algorithm

* Need protocol for algorithm development and prototyping
* Back and forth instructions to paper - need several mockups

### Teacher Notes && Overview

This part 1 project will lead directly into part 2 of the final - it's important that students are set up for success and create thoughtful artistic algorithms now to ensure a smooth process in part 2.

Please note that suggestions for the amount of prototype outputs are _just suggestions_ - you are welcome to adjust this to meet the needs or typical structures of your class.&#x20;

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Create artistic algorithms that other students are able to follow.
* Create prototypes of their algorithm output.

### Suggested Duration

1 - 3 Days, depending on the pace of student work

### Resources

* NEED PLANNING GUIDE

### Project Launch && Prompt
