# ðŸŽ¨ Final Project Pt 1: Create an Algorithm

* Need protocol for algorithm development and prototyping
* Back and forth instructions to paper - need several mockups

### Teacher Notes && Overview

This part 1 project will lead directly into part 2 of the final - it's important that students are set up for success and create thoughtful artistic algorithms now to ensure a smooth process in part 2.

Please note that suggestions for the amount of prototype outputs are _just suggestions_ - you are welcome to adjust this to meet the needs or typical structures of your class.&#x20;

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Create artistic algorithms that other students are able to follow.
* Create prototypes of their algorithm output.

### Suggested Duration

1 - 3 Days, depending on the pace of student work

### Resources

* [Final Project Planning Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PzLbwPX8I00Z\_pOY1llU-8SNtoAPw7k0Pov6GdXAmVU/copy)

### Project Launch && Prompt

Begin by telling students that they are going to have a chance to show off everything they learned in this unit in a two-part final project: first, they will create an algorithm that can be followed to make art. Then, they will receive a few randomly selected algorithms from their classmates and will be tasked with making different art pieces from them.\
\
Before we get there, students must create their algorithm. They will actually create _three_ algorithms and then select their favorite that they would like to submit to the pool other students will be assigned from.

**Project Prompt:**

1. Reflect on what you have learned to do with code, and what materials you have access to in your classroom. _(The part 2 project will involve digital and analog creation!)_
2. Write 3 separate artistic algorithms that could be followed by someone else to create work.
3. For each algorithm, create 2-3 thumbnail/prototype/diagram sketches of _possible_ outcomes. The best algorithms should be specific enough that you know what to do, but open-ended enough that you could conceivably make something a little different each time.
4. Submit your planning packet to your teacher. Your selected algorithm should be clear and include any additional materials needed. (_EX: If you say 'Draw 5 eyes...' you may want a diagram of what you imagine an eye to look like._)&#x20;
