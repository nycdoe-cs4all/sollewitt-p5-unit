# Final Project Pt 2: Create from an Algorithm (Final Critique and Defense)

* Students create a piece from another student's randomly selected algorithm
  * Piece can be digital or traditional media
  * Scale is up to them
  * Display is up to them
  * BUT, they must defend their decisions
* Need: final defense/presentation requirements
  * Why the choices they made?
  * How would changes make the work be perceived differently?
* Need: Final Critique Protocol
  * Questions, format, etc.
