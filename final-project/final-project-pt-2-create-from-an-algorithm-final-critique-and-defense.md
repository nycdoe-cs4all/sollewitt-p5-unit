# ðŸŽ¨ Final Project Pt 2: Create from an Algorithm (Final Critique and Defense)

### Teacher Notes && Overview

Prior to the launch of this project, students should have created their own algorithms and possible execution prototypes. Teachers will need to collect and make copies of student algorithms to distribute.

As this is the culminating project of the unit, please feel free to take an appropriate amount of time for students to finish work that they are proud of.&#x20;

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Create art from an algorithm in multiple formats
* Defend their creation choices
* Critique the work of peers

### Suggested Duration

3 - 7 Days, depending on the scale of work

### Resources

* [p5 Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) | [repl.it](https://replit.com/\~)
* Traditional art supplies:
  * Whatever is available + large format paper and/or gessoed masonite

### Project Launch and Prompt

Students will be given algorithms that their peers have created and asked to create art from them. Our suggestion is to give students three algorithms and allow them to choose one to visually execute using code, one to visually execute using traditional media, and one that they can choose between.

While all three given algorithms can come from students, you may choose to have two student algorithms and one Sol Le Witt thrown in the mix; feel free to play with the variety to best fit the needs of your classroom. **If you only have students submitting and they only submit one algorithm**, create three copies and put a copy in each of three piles. Shuffle each and allow students to choose one algorithm from each pile. If students submit all three algorithms, students will pick from one large group of all algorithms. _Try to avoid letting students selectively pick algorithms - this should be a little random, like a card draw!_\
\
Scale of pieces should be up to students. Depending on the environment, it may be possible for some students to ask to create directly on walls of the school with advanced planning.

**Project Requirements:**

1. Create three pieces, one for each algorithm. You should have one coded piece, one piece in traditional media, and one piece in a media of your choice.
   1. _For each piece, you should create 1-2 prototype drawings before beginning._
2. **For the digital piece:**
   1. Look for ways to add interactivity and responsiveness to the piece.
3. Students will create a final defense/presentation (see below) encapsulating all three of their pieces as a body of work.

### Final Defense/Presentation Requirements

In their final defense/presentation, students should display all three of their pieces with the stated algorithm. (If the work becomes too large, displaying via a slide show would be acceptable.)\
\
They should answer the following questions (or be able to answer them in the critique process). Presentations should be roughly 5 minutes.

1. Discuss your creative process throughout this unit. How did you brainstorm, iterate, and refine your ideas from the initial algorithm to the final artwork?
2. What artistic decisions did you make during the execution of the algorithms? How did you adapt or modify the algorithm to achieve your artistic vision?
3. Why did you choose the specific media (digital, traditional, or a medium of your choice) for each of the three art pieces? What impact does the choice of media have on the final artwork and its message?
4. Discuss any obstacles or challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. Did you have to make any changes to your initial plan?
5. Reflect on your personal growth during this unit. What new skills or insights did you gain in both art and programming? What would you do differently if you were to do this project again?

### Final Critique Protocol

Immediately following each presentation, students should enter critique mode. As the teacher, emphasize the importance of respectful and constructive critique. Students should be encouraged to share both warm and cool feedback, and also think about the following questions - they may answer or ask the presenter for further information:

1. What is your initial reaction or emotional response to this artwork? What do you notice first?
2. What elements of art (color, line, shape, texture, etc.) do you see in this artwork, and how do they contribute to its overall effect?
3. Can you identify any specific artistic or algorithmic decisions that were made during the creation of this artwork? How do these choices contribute to the piece's overall impact?
4. What suggestions do you have for the artist to enhance their work or explore new ideas in future projects?
5. (Time Permitting, at teacher discretion) Ask the student who created the algorithm their thoughts on the execution; does it match their vision? What unexpected things may have occurred? How would this change their creation of an algorithm in the future?

### Final Reflection (Optional Formats)

Depending on how you would like to close out your unit, you may want this to take the form of a class discussion, another chalk talk, or an independent reflection collected via Google Forms or similar.

After looking at the class collection of work, discuss:

1. How does your algorithm-based art relate to Sol LeWitt's work and the concept of conceptual art? Are there specific elements or ideas from his work that influenced your project?
2. Reflect on the relationship between art and technology. How did this unit change your perspective on what can be considered art in a digital age?
3. Are there any ethical considerations related to using algorithms in art? How did you address these considerations in your project?
4. What do you see as the potential future applications of algorithmic art? How has this unit influenced your future interests and creative endeavors?
